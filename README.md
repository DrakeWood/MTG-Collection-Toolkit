### Deckcheck Trim Assistant

This tool helps remove cards from your deck the that Deckcheck Trim suggests to remove.

#### Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.x and the `pandas` library are installed.
2. Run the script using this command or launch in python from file explorer:

   ```sh
   python trim.py
   ```

3. Copy and paste your Deck list from the Archidekt import and the Trim List from Deckcheck into the GUI.
4. Copy and paste your updated list into Archidekt import, replacing everything existing.

### Manabox Value Balancer

ValueBalancer is a tool for assigning proportional prices to a group of cards based on their current values, making it especially useful when opening packs. Instead of dividing the cost evenly across all cards, ValueBalancer adjusts each card's price to reflect its share of the pack's total value.

For example (with easy numbers), if you open a $10 pack with 5 cards and pull:

3 cards worth $10 each
1 card worth $20
1 card worth $0

Value Balancer will set the "purchased prices" as follows:

$2 for each $10 card (3 x $2 = $6)
$4 for the $20 card (1 x $4 = $4)
$0 for the worthless card

This ensures the total cost ($10) is distributed fairly, reflecting each card's value rather than using a flat average. This approach provides more accurate tracking for trades, sales, or collection management.

Here is an example of a freshly scanned Foundations Starter Collection bundle scanned in with default pricing set, and then with the tool.

#### Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.x and the `pandas` library are installed.
2. Run the script using this command or launch in python from file explorer:

   ```sh
   python value_balancer.py
   ```

3. Export your binder from Manabox as a CSV.
4. Load the CSV into the value balancer.
5. Enter the price that was paid for all of the cards in this binder total and click run conversion.
6. Import the new CSV with updated values into Manabox.
7. Delete the original binder.
